# What's inside
A small node.js server with already configured webpack and all the stuff.

The `index.html` is inside `public` folder, just nearby the `bundle.js` - webpacked code.

Inside `public/js` you can find the application entrance file `app.js`, as well as the main react component, `ExamplesForm.js`.

Inside `public/js/forms` you can see different forms descriptions that are used in this example.
